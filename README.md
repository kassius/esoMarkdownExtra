=====================

Markdown Extra Plugin for esoTalk

It is working but has some bugs, , like those related with `>` (ex., blockquotes) because esoTalk escapes it with `&lgt;` and some related to css.

It is also needed to add some other different css for member controller, for showing members posts.
